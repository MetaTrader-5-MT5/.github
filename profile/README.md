## MetaTrader 5 (MT5)

MetaTrader 5 (MT5) is the successor to MetaTrader 4 (MT4), designed to offer more advanced features, improved functionality, and a broader range of tools for trading across multiple asset classes. While MT5 retains many of the core features of MT4, it introduces new capabilities, including support for additional asset types (such as stocks and futures), improved charting tools, and a more robust trading infrastructure. MT5 is ideal for traders who need a more versatile and feature-rich platform, offering access to a wide range of asset classes, advanced order management tools, and enhanced analysis capabilities. While it retains many of the qualities that made MT4 popular, MT5 is designed to meet the needs of more sophisticated traders who require additional flexibility, functionality, and trading opportunities.
